# Dynamic Course and Branch Management System

## 📋 Overview

This system transforms the hardcoded course and branch structure into a fully dynamic, database-driven management system. Administrators can now add, edit, and manage courses and branches through a user-friendly interface.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema

#### Course Model (`server/src/models/Course.js`)
```javascript
{
  name: String,           // Course name (e.g., "B.Tech")
  code: String,           // Unique course code (e.g., "BTECH")
  description: String,    // Course description
  duration: Number,       // Duration in years/semesters
  durationUnit: String,   // "years" or "semesters"
  isActive: Boolean,      // Soft delete flag
  createdBy: ObjectId,    // Reference to Admin who created it
  timestamps: true
}
```

#### Branch Model (`server/src/models/Branch.js`)
```javascript
{
  name: String,           // Branch name (e.g., "Computer Science Engineering")
  code: String,           // Unique branch code (e.g., "CSE")
  course: ObjectId,       // Reference to Course
  description: String,    // Branch description
  isActive: Boolean,      // Soft delete flag
  createdBy: ObjectId,    // Reference to Admin who created it
  timestamps: true
}
```

#### Updated User Model
- `course`: Now references `Course` model (ObjectId)
- `branch`: Now references `Branch` model (ObjectId)
- Year validation updated to work with dynamic courses

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Setup

#### Run the Seed Script
```bash
cd server
node src/scripts/seedCoursesAndBranches.js
```

This creates the initial courses and branches:
- **B.Tech** (4 years): CSE, ECE, EEE, MECH, CIVIL, AI, AI & ML
- **Diploma** (3 years): DAIML, DCSE, DECE, DME, DAP, D Fisheries, D Animal Husbandry
- **Pharmacy** (4 years): B-Pharmacy, Pharm D, Pharm(PB) D, Pharmaceutical Analysis, Pharmaceutics, Pharma Quality Assurance
- **Degree** (3 years): Agriculture, Horticulture, Food Technology, Fisheries, Food Science & Nutrition
- **MBA** (2 years): Finance, Marketing, HR, IT, Operations Management
- **MCA** (3 years): Computer Applications, Software Engineering, Data Science

#### Run the Migration Script (if upgrading from hardcoded system)
```bash
cd server
node src/scripts/migrateToDynamicCourses.js
```

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

#### Course Management
- `GET /api/course-management/courses` - Get active courses
- `GET /api/course-management/courses/all` - Get all courses (admin)
- `POST /api/course-management/courses` - Create new course
- `PUT /api/course-management/courses/:id` - Update course
- `DELETE /api/course-management/courses/:id` - Deactivate course

#### Branch Management
- `GET /api/course-management/branches/:courseId` - Get branches by course
- `GET /api/course-management/branches` - Get all branches (admin)
- `POST /api/course-management/branches` - Create new branch
- `PUT /api/course-management/branches/:id` - Update branch
- `DELETE /api/course-management/branches/:id` - Deactivate branch

#### Utility Endpoints
- `GET /api/course-management/courses-with-branches` - Get courses with their branches

### 3. Frontend Components

#### CourseManagement Component (`client/src/pages/admin/CourseManagement.jsx`)
- **Courses Tab**: Manage all courses with CRUD operations
- **Branches Tab**: Manage branches grouped by course
- **Modal Forms**: Add/edit courses and branches
- **Validation**: Real-time form validation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

#### AdminManagement Integration
- New "Courses & Branches" tab added to Admin Management
- Seamless integration with existing admin interface
- Role-based access control (super_admin only)

## 📊 Database Relationships

```
Admin (createdBy) → Course
Admin (createdBy) → Branch
Course ← Branch (course)
User (course) → Course
User (branch) → Branch
```

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

- **Super Admin Only**: Course and branch management restricted to super admins
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT token
- **Role Validation**: Backend validates user permissions
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Mongoose ODM provides protection

## 🚨 Migration Considerations

### Before Migration
1. **Backup Database**: Always backup before running migration
2. **Test Environment**: Test migration on staging first
3. **Downtime Planning**: Plan for brief downtime during migration

### Migration Process
1. **Seed Courses**: Creates new course records
2. **Seed Branches**: Creates new branch records
3. **Update Users**: Migrates existing user data to new structure
4. **Validation**: Ensures data integrity

### After Migration
1. **Verify Data**: Check that all users have correct course/branch references
2. **Test Functionality**: Ensure all features work with new structure
3. **Update Frontend**: Ensure forms use new dynamic data

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Adding a New Course
1. Navigate to Admin Management → Courses & Branches
2. Click "Add Course"
3. Fill in:
   - Course Name: "M.Tech"
   - Course Code: "MTECH"
   - Description: "Master of Technology program"
   - Duration: 2
   - Duration Unit: years
4. Click "Create"

### Adding a New Branch
1. Navigate to Admin Management → Courses & Branches
2. Switch to "Branches" tab
3. Click "Add Branch"
4. Fill in:
   - Course: Select "B.Tech"
   - Branch Name: "Data Science"
   - Branch Code: "DS"
   - Description: "Data Science specialization"
5. Click "Create"

### Managing Existing Data

## 🔄 API Integration

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Fetch courses
const courses = await api.get('/api/course-management/courses');

// Fetch branches for a course
const branches = await api.get(`/api/course-management/branches/${courseId}`);

// Create new course
const newCourse = await api.post('/api/course-management/courses', courseData);

// Update course
const updatedCourse = await api.put(`/api/course-management/courses/${courseId}`, updateData);
```

### Backend Integration
```javascript
// In controllers, populate course and branch data
const students = await User.find()
  .populate('course', 'name code')
  .populate('branch', 'name code');
```
